## About Me

Computer Science PhD Researcher at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/bigdata/people/people/mcquirejamie.html) investigating the design and implementation of decentralized analytic systems for wearable healthcare applications.


## Research Summary

My research investigates the design and implementation of next generation sensors and analytics systems for the analysis of wearable sensor data. I am investigating how [federated learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf) systems can
be designed to run at-scale using inexpensive, low-powered devices for the analysis of data generated from wearable devices. This work involves creating a mulit-layer, cloud-edge computing system that will enable the deployment of federated learning algorithms at-scale.  Federated Learning is an important topic in machine learning as it allows practitioners to train analytical models across decentralised data-sources. This is incredibly useful in situations where personal data is being collected and cannot be directly uploaded to cloud infrastructures - either due to privacy regulations, such as, the GDPR and HIPAA, and also where bandwidth constraints prohibits continuous data uploads (deployment in developing economies). The majority of the analytics is done locally on edge-computing nodes, where computational and communication resources are scarce - motivating the design of resource-efficient machine learning methods.
